    "text": "1. Introduction\nThe Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [1, 2] offers a simple method for measuring traits and conducting statistical inference from comparative judgment (CJ) data [3, 4].\nIts simplicity stems from two features:\n\n\n\nA reliance on an extensive set of simplifying assumptions about the traits, judges, and stimuli involved in CJ assessments [5, 6],\nThe use of ad hoc procedures to handle inferences, including hypothesis testing [4].\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent studies question whether:\n\n\n\nThese assumptions hold in modern CJ applications? [6–8]\nThe ad hoc procedures effectively fulfill their intended analytical purpose? [7, 8]"

Extends the general form of Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment [5, 9], combining Thurstone’s core theoretical principles with key CJ assessment design features.\n2. Enables the development of models tailored to the assumed data-generating process of the CJ system under study, thus:\n\n\n\nEliminating the need to rely on the simplifying assumptions of the BTL model,\nRemoving the dependence on ad hoc hypothesis-testing procedures.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, although approach has the potential to yield reliable trait estimates and accurate statistical inferences, this promise still needs to be empirically tested."

Discussion\nThe CBTL analysis results provide preliminary evidence that,\n\n\n\nResearchers cannot treat “sample-freeness” as an inherent property of the BTL model, contrary to previous beliefs [3, 6]. Instead, the property depends on the specific data under analysis.\nWhen judges exhibit bias, the CBTL analysis fails to capture the complexity of the traits [3, 6, 7, 9], producing inaccurate and unreliable estimates [47–50]. This limitation is particularly evident in the estimation of inference parameters and judges’ biases.\nThe common CJ practice of separating trait estimation from hypothesis testing [11, 12, 14, 51–54], introduces bias and reduces the reliability of inferences [49, 50, 55].\nThe BTL model is overconfident when predicting comparison outcomes, as shown by the posterior predictive checks based on the expected values."

    "text": "6. Discussion\nMoreover, the CBTL analysis results also provide preliminary evidence that,\n\n\n\nDespite its statistical definition as an outlier detection tool [8], misfit analysis fail to detect ‘extreme’ cases;\nDespite its conceptual definition as a “lack-of-consensus” identification tool [4, 10], misfit analysis does not consistently classify all stimuli, judges or individual exhibiting consensus or lack of consensus (see Figure 24);\nNote: The definition of consensus aligns with the microeconomics’ concept of transitivity, that is, if \\(A \\succ B \\succ C\\), then \\(A \\succ C\\) [56]. As Pollit [10] explains: “If a portfolio’s WMS exceeds the criterion of mean plus two standard deviations, this means the judges did not judge it consistently, some considering it ‘better’ than others did. Significant portfolio misfit indicates a specific difference between judges in how they would rank order the portfolios, arising from a difference in how they understand or value the trait they are trying to assess.”\nIn fact, as show in this study, simple features of the data-generating process can produce lack of consensus or transitivity. For example, \\(\\text{IA}[6,3] \\succ \\text{IA}[6,7] \\succ \\text{IA}[31,6]\\), but \\(\\text{IA}[31,6] \\succ \\text{IA}[6,3]\\) (see Figure 24);\nThen, as expected, excluding misfitting stimuli and judges in a second model fit [4, 10] does not improve trait estimation nor inferences, as the model continues to struggle with ‘extreme’ stimuli and unmodeled data features."

Discussion\nIn contrast, results from the ITCJ analysis indicate that,\n\n\n\nThe frequentist BTL model and its equivalent Bayesian ITCJ models (models \\(1-3\\)) show similar insufficient fit; however, the ITCJ models exhibit a slightly better recovery performance due to the regularizing influence of weakly informative priors (see parameter recovery and RMSE plots).\nNote: ITCJ models \\(1-3\\) can be estimated with the BTm() function; however, the practice is largely absent in the current CJ literature.\nIncorporating the hierarchical structure of stimuli and accounting for judges’ biases (ITCJ model \\(4\\)) improves the prediction of comparison outcomes by up to \\(10\\) percentage points in the overall True Positives (TP) and True Negatives (TN), as indicated by posterior predictive checks, more than including covariates in the model (model \\(3\\)).\nExpanding the model to include the hierarchical structure of stimuli, judges’ biases, heterogeneity in discriminal dispersions, and measurement error in inferences (ITCJ model \\(6\\)) enhances both the accuracy and reliability of all trait estimates and inference parameters.\nITCJ model \\(6\\) enables to test other inferences not available under the CBTL analysis"
