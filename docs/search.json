    "text": "1. Introduction\nThe Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [1, 2] offers a simple method for measuring traits and conducting statistical inference from comparative judgment (CJ) data [3, 4]. Its simplicity stems from two features:\n\n\n\nA reliance on an extensive set of simplifying assumptions about the traits, judges, and stimuli involved in CJ assessments [5, 6],\nThe use of ad hoc procedures to handle inferences, including hypothesis testing [4].\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent studies question:\n\n\n\nDo these assumptions hold in modern CJ applications? [6–8]\nDo the ad hoc procedures effectively fulfill their intended analytical purpose? [7, 8]"

[8] proposed The Information-Theoretical model for CJ.\nThe approach extends the general form of Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment [5, 9], combining Thurstone’s core theoretical principles with key CJ assessment design features.\nThis integration enables the development of models tailored to the assumed data-generating process of the CJ system under study, thus:\n\n\n\nEliminating the need to rely on the simplifying assumptions of the BTL model,\nRemoving the dependence on ad hoc hypothesis-testing procedures.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, although approach has the potential to yield reliable trait estimates and accurate statistical inferences, this promise still needs to be empirically tested."
