    "text": "1. Introduction\nThe Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model [1, 2] offers a simple method for measuring traits and conducting statistical inference from comparative judgment (CJ) data [3, 4].\nIts simplicity stems from two features:\n\n\n\nA reliance on an extensive set of simplifying assumptions about the traits, judges, and stimuli involved in CJ assessments [5, 6],\nThe use of ad hoc procedures to handle inferences, including hypothesis testing [4].\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent studies question whether:\n\n\n\nThese assumptions hold in modern CJ applications? [6–8]\nThe ad hoc procedures effectively fulfill their intended analytical purpose? [7, 8]"

Extends the general form of Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment [5, 9], combining Thurstone’s core theoretical principles with key CJ assessment design features.\n2. Enables the development of models tailored to the assumed data-generating process of the CJ system under study, thus:\n\n\n\nEliminating the need to rely on the simplifying assumptions of the BTL model,\nRemoving the dependence on ad hoc hypothesis-testing procedures.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, although approach has the potential to yield reliable trait estimates and accurate statistical inferences, this promise still needs to be empirically tested."

    "text": "6. Discussion\nMoreover, the CBTL analysis results provide preliminary evidence that,\n\n\n\nResearchers cannot treat “sample-freeness” as an inherent property of the BTL model, contrary to previous beliefs [3, 6]. Instead, the property depends on the specific data under analysis.\nWhen judges exhibit biases, the simplifying assumptions of the BTL model fail to capture the complexity of the simulated traits [3, 6, 7, 9], producing inaccurate and unreliable trait estimates [46–49]. This limitation is particularly evident in estimating judges’ biases.\nThe BTL model is overconfident when predicting comparison outcomes, as shown by the posterior predictive checks.\nThe BTL model struggles to accurately estimate the traits of certain ‘extreme’ stimuli, even though the simulation does not generate such stimuli.\nThe ad hoc misfit analysis procedure fails to achieve its intended analytical purpose [7], because it miss classifies valid stimuli as misfits and fails to identify all biased judges [8].\nThe common CJ practice of excluding misfit stimuli and judges from the model fit [4, 10] does not improve trait estimation.\nSeparating trait estimation from hypothesis testing, another common CJ practice [11, 12, 14, 50–53], introduces bias and reduces the reliability of inferences [48, 49, 54]."

Discussion\nIn contrast, results from the ITCJ analysis indicate that,\n\n\n\nThe frequentist and the equivalent Bayesian ITCJ models (models \\(1-3\\)) have similarly insufficient fit and recovery performance.\nIncorporating the hierarchical structure of stimuli and accounting for judges’ biases (i.e., ITCJ model \\(4\\)) improves the prediction of comparison outcomes by up to \\(10\\) percentage points, as indicated by the posterior predictive checks.\nExpanding the model to include the hierarchical structure of stimuli, judges’ biases, heterogeneity in discriminal dispersions, and measurement error in inferences (i.e., ITCJ model \\(6\\)) enhances both the accuracy and reliability of trait estimation and the accuracy of statistical inferences. This improvement is evident across all traits and parameters."
